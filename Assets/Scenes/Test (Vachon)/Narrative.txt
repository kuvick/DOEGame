1 Okay, here's the deal: The local city is in trouble.

2 Their contract with the area utilities provider has ended...

3 and they don't have the connections to broker a new contract.

4 That's why they've asked for your help.

5 Yes, you specifically. Don't let it get to your head bucko.

6 Our other agents are going to be assigned elsewhere, so you don't have any back on this one.

7 Well, what are you still doing in my office?

8 Get out there and sort out the problem!

RV05 - Narrative (needs work)

It looks like the new industrial plant in the northern section of town needs more power than we have available.

There's an old powerplant down the road from that new factory we should try to use that to provide power. 

The town's new budget restrictions will limit our ability to supply the fuel So we're going to try something different.

We'll take the waste from the city and town, process it, then use that for fuel. It solves the problem of waste disposal and power generation with one stone.
