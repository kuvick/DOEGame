Premise: Use existing resources to provide local utilities.

Doctor Edison:
Okay, here's the deal: The local city is in trouble.
Their contract with the area utilities provider has ended...
and they don't have the connections to broker a new contract.
That's why they've asked for your help.
Yes, you specifically. Don't let it get to your head bucko.
Our other agents are going to be assigned elsewhere, 
So you don't have any back on this one.
Well, what are you still doing in my office?
Get out there and sort out the problem!

RV02

Premise: Provide local utilities to housing development

Nancy Sanders:
Hey there newbie!
So that new housing development has been finished, 
And people are ready to move in,
But the contracting company failed to set up the utilities. 
So the buildings can't pass inspection.
We've got more than a few families waiting out in the cold, 
All so their houses can be declared "legally safe".
You've been assigned two Energy Engineers.
With that much backup, we should be able to solve the problem no sweat!
Let's roll out the welcome mats for these people!

Premise: Pump waste CO2 into the oil wells to produce more oil efficiently.

RV04 

Premise: Develop, teach and train a workforce that knows how to implement a new efficient solar panel system.

RV05 

Premise: Burn waste to produce enough power for the local factory.

Doctor Edison:
We have a problem.
The new industrial plant north of town needs more power than we have available.

Nancy Sanders:
There's an old powerplant down the road...
We could try to use that to provide power. 

Doctor Edison
The town's new budget restrictions will limit our ability to supply fuel. If we do this, we're going have to try something different.

You:
We could take waste from the city and town.
If we process it, that waste can be turned into fuel. 
It disposes of the waste and solves the power problem.

Doctor Edison
There's thinking with your noodle.

Nancy Sanders:
Great idea!

Doctor Edison:
Why don't you help the newbie with this project.

Nancy Sanders:
Sure thing!
I'll be waiting for you at the Gas Station when you get there.
Just pick me up there and I'll help ya out.
