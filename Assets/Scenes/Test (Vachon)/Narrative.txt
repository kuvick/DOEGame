Vachon06-July14 (STABLE) - Narrative

Uh oh, it looks like the new industrial plant in the northern section of town needs more power than we have available.

Hey, I've got an idea. There's an old powerplant down the road from that new factory. We could use that to provide power. 

But the town's new budget restrictions will limit our ability to supply the fuel it needs to run the boilers.

Well how about this? We take the waste from the city and town, process it, and use it for fuel? That'll save us from spending on coal.

Great idea! Not only that, but all of the waste will turn to sanitized ash so we wont have to worry about the landfill any longer. All we'll need to do is create some jobs to staff it.

Sounds like a win to me!

A local university has built a few dormitories around the city. We need to help connect them to the grid. The catch is that they want their source of juice to be ecologically friendly. We have an undercover energy agent nearby who can help set up those connections.

We have a contractor who has contacted us recently. It seems he has built a home near our new "Renewable Energy Zone". We've delt with this person before, they actually built the ethanol farms in the area. They are interested in running the new house entirely off the renewable energy grid we've developed.

I remember them, last time we talked, they had this great idea to feed excess power generated from the "Renewable Energy Zone" back into the grid.

That's not a bad idea right there...

Vachon02-July14 (STABLE) - Narrative

We've got a new housing development, but we're short on staff to make the energy connections. You should enlist the help of some independant agents in the area to help you make those connections. I know just the folks to help!

Vachon01-July14 (STABLE) - Narrative

A local city has decided to begin making the move to more sustainable energy sources. While they can't disregard the existing energy resources available, they can replace the old and out of date areas. We need you to help them make the connections they need to get going.
