Vachon06-July24 (STABLE) - Narrative

Uh oh, it looks like the new industrial plant in the northern section of town needs more power than we have available.

Hey, I've got an idea. There's an old powerplant down the road from that new factory. We could use that to provide power. 

But the town's new budget restrictions will limit our ability to supply the fuel it needs to run the boilers.

Well how about this? We take the waste from the city and town, process it, and use it for fuel? That'll save us from spending on coal.

Great idea! Not only that, but all of the waste will turn to sanitized ash so we wont have to worry about the landfill any longer. All we'll need to do is create some jobs to staff it.

Sounds like a win to me!
