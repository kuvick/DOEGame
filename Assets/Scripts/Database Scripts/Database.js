Database.js
By Katharine Uvick

This script will be used to store data of the different specific buildings
involved in the game, as well as the buildings currently placed on the grid.
It also contains the scripts to alter the data (to link buildings, add them to
the grid, etc.)

It uses a series of arrays to store the data in order to keep the information
organized and flexible, rather than a fixed matrix or 2d array that would need
to be detailed on what each column and row represented.

Also contains undo functionality.

UPDATE REMINDER: See DefaultBuildingEditor to change the values of the default
buildings.

Building Class

Instead of just creating a 2D array/matrix, I decided that creating a class for a building
would make it easier to understand the structure of the database (since for the matrix I would
have to create in the comments an explaination as to what which row and column held).

Also, since not all buildings share the same input and output, or even the same amounts of input
and output, this will allow for flexiblity in that regard as well. Since the amount of a specific
resource a building might need is not always 1, that's what the Num arrays are; the corrisponding
values at the matching indexes should indicate the number of resources needed or output by the 
resource named in the other array.

NOTE: This class and the one below uses parallel arrays to store the resource input/output type
and their amounts.
