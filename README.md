# Terrachanics

Terrachanics is a turn-based puzzle game aiming to recruit aspiring engineers and STEM field graduates into careers with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Players solve a series of increasingly complex puzzles to unlock information about cutting edge energy technologies, as well as learn about the many exciting opportunities the DOE has to offer.

#Gameplay
Terrachanics is made up of three core mechanics:
* Linking - Like connect the dots, but sometimes paths branch off or converge in tricky ways
* Buidling - Like placing a piece in a jigsaw puzzle, but with a focus on timing and map awareness
* Units - Send your Engineer off to repair a broken pipe, or your Agent to hand off the blueprints for a new nuclear plant. Just be sure to time their momves carefully to make sure they arrive in time!

#Features
* 50 levels of increasing difficulty
* Codex gallery of unlockable entries on cutting-edge technology
* Fun and goofy storyline spoofing the superspy genre
